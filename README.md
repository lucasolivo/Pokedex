Welcome to the Command Line Pokedex! To start up the Pokedex, run "go run ." and the Pokedex will fire up!
You can call the 'help' command to view all the possible commands in the Pokedex. 
More features are being added soon...

Data is sourced through PokeAPI.

Update 5/23: Added the ability (x) command. generates 1-10 random abilities to use on a pokemon! Use this to randomize pokemon on pokehax for fun or just to see some abilities and their effects.

Also added levels when catching a pokemon (between 1 and 10) and added a command to level a pokemon by 1 ('candy')

Update 6/11: Added a 'party' command that lets the user see their current party of 6 and their leading pokemon. Will add a box and switch and switchlead command later.

Update 6/12: Added a save and load feature along with a reset option, so that the Pokedex and party persist after the program is exited. Also added a makeCommands function to clean up the repl.go file.
